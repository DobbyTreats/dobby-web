Dobby is the name of the beautiful dog you see above 🐶. _This token is made for educational purposes._

- [DobbyToken](./contracts/contracts/DobbyToken.sol) is an ERC-20 token.
- [DobbyTreats](./contracts/contracts/DobbyTreats.sol) are unique ERC-721 NFTs where each represents a dog treat.
- [DobbyDEX](./contracts/contracts/DobbyDEX.sol) is the decentralized exchange to swap ether for Dobby tokens.

The plan for this token is as follows:

1. An NFT sale of DobbyTreats will be made.
2. A sale of DobbyToken will be made afterwards.
3. Once the sale ends, DobbyToken will only be tradable at other decentralized exchanges.
4. Initial holders of DobbyTreats can cash their NFT's out for DobbyTokens.
